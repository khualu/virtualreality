# The Human Interface

> As a material for design and an ingredient in interactions, words need to emerge from the content shed and be considered from the start. The way humans use language—easily, joyfully, sometimes painfully—should anchor the foundation of all interactions with digital systems.

## Orality, say it with me

> Before literacy, words were ephemeral and all knowledge was social and communal. There was no “save” option and no intellectual property. The only way to sustain an idea was to share it, speaking aloud to another person in a way that made it easy for them to remember. This was _orality_—the first interface.

> Far as a man with his eyes sees into the mist of the distance

> Sitting aloft on a crag to gaze over the wine-dark seaway,

> Just so far were the loud-neighing steeds of the gods overleaping.

> —Iliad, 5.770

 Concrete images like _rosy-fingered dawn, loud-neighing steeds, wine-dark seaway_, and _swift-footed Achilles_ served to aid the teller and to sear the story into the listener’s memory.

### The qualities of oral culture

 In _Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word_, Walter Ong explored the “psychodynamics of orality,” which is, coincidentally, quite a mouthful. Through his research, he found that the ability to preserve ideas in writing not only increased knowledge, it altered values and behavior. People who grow up and live in a community that has never known writing are different from literate people—they depend upon one another to preserve and share knowledge. This makes for a completely different, and much more intimate, relationship between ideas and communities.

### Oral culture is immediate and social

In a society without writing, communication can happen only in the moment and face-to-face. It sounds like the introvert’s nightmare! Oral culture has several other hallmarks as well:

* **Spoken words are events that exist in time.** It’s impossible to step back and examine a spoken word or phrase. While the speaker can try to repeat, there’s no way to capture or replay an utterance.
* **All knowledge is social, and lives in memory**. Formulas and patterns are essential to transmitting and retaining knowledge. When the knowledge stops being interesting to the audience, it stops existing.
* **Individuals need to be present to exchange knowledge or communicate.** All communication is participatory and immediate. The speaker can adjust the message to the context. Conversation, contention, and struggle help to retain this new knowledge.
* **The community owns knowledge, not individuals.** Everyone draws on the same themes, so not only is originality not helpful, it’s nonsensical to claim an idea as your own.
* **There are no dictionaries or authoritative sources.** The right use of a word is determined by how it’s being used right now.

### Literate culture promotes authority and ownership

Printed books enabled mass-distribution and dispensed with handicraft of manuscripts, alienating readers from the source of the ideas, and from each other. \(Ong pg. 100\):

* The printed text is an independent physical object. Ideas can be preserved as a thing, completely apart from the thinker.
* Portable printed works enable individual consumption. The need and desire for private space accompanied the emergence of silent, solo reading.
* **Print creates a sense of private ownership of words.** Plagiarism is possible.
* Individual attribution is possible. The ability to identify a sole author increases the value of originality andcreativity.
* Print fosters a sense of closure. Once a work is printed, it is final and closed.

### Techonology brought us together again

 All that studying allowed people to accumulate and share knowledge, speeding up the pace of technological change. And technology transformed communication in turn. It took less than 150 years to get from the telegraph to the World Wide Web. And with the web—a technology that requires literacy—Ong identified a return to the values of the earlier oral culture. He called this _secondary orality_. Then he died in 2003, before the rise of the mobile internet, when things _really_ got interesting.

Secondary orality is:

* Immediate. There is no necessary delay between the expression of an idea and its reception. Physical distance is meaningless.
* **Socially aware and group-minded.** The number of people who can hear and see the same thing simultaneously is in the billions.
* Conversational. This is in the sense of being both more interactive and less formal.
* Collaborative. Communication invites and enables a response, which may then become part of the message.
* **Intertextual.** The products of our culture reflect and influence one another.

Social, ephemeral, participatory, anti-authoritarian, and opposed to individual ownership of ideas—these qualities sound a lot like internet culture.

## From documents to events

 Most advice on “writing for the web” or “creating content” starts from the presumption that we are “writing,” just for a different medium. But when we approach communication as an assembly of pieces of content rather than an interaction, customers who might have been expecting a conversation end up feeling like they’ve been handed a manual instead.

Software is on a path to participating in our culture as a peer. So, it should behave like a person—alive and present. It doesn’t matter how much so-called machine intelligence is under the hood—a perceptive set of programmatic responses, rather than a series of documents, can be enough if they have the qualities ofconversation.

Interactive systems should evoke the best qualities of living human communities—active, social, simple, and present—not passive, isolated, complex, or closed off.
